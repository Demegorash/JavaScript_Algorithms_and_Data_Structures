/*

Step 26
Were you expecting to see 4 in the console? .push() returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.

It is important to be aware of what values a method returns. Take some time to experiment with .push() and .pop(). When you are ready, remove all of your .push() and .pop() calls, and your console.log statements

let pushed = rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
console.log(pushed);
let popped = rows.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(rows);

// Resolution

let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;

let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
