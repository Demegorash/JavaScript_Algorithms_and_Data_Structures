Step 28
Declaring a variable with the let keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.

For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.

First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:

const firstName = "Naomi";
firstName = "Jessica";

A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:

Replace your let keywords with const.

let character = "Hello";
let count = 8;
let rows = [];
*/

// Resolution

const character = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
