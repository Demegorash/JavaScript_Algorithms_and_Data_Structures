Step 34
Your loop should now run eight times. Inside the body of the loop, print the value of the i iterator and see what happens.

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {

}

// Resolution

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
    console.log(i);
